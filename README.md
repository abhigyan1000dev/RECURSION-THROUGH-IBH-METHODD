# RECURSION-THROUGH-IBH-METHOD

WE HAVE SOLVED AMAZING PROBLEMS USNG THE IBH METHOD . <br />
BASICALLY IBH STANDS FOR
<strong>
- INDUCTION
- BASE
- HYPOTHESIS
</strong>
These  three are the condition in which we have divided our  entire recursive  problem.  <br />
<strong> <em> Base Conditions </em> </strong> means the critical point of put recursive problem where it probably gonna stop.<br />
i.e <br />
if(root==NULL) <br />
{ <br />
return ; <br />
} <br />


<strong> <em> Hypothesis  </em> </strong>part means the Breaking down part i.e the writing the problem for just one smaller step  <br />
 
 <strong> <em>Induction  </em> </strong>is the part where we are gonna get the desired the output through our code .<br />
 We manipulate it as per wish.
